Hi Will!
<p>
Thanks for the opportunity to express my design methodology while tackling a sample problem.  This submission is skewed towards UX because I normally consult existing style guides when working on single components of already established or much larger apps. 
<p>
Having said that, the process for me begins with grokking the brief, problem statements, or any other available resources that can help define the current state of the application and the desired outcome.  That typically involves a research phase, where I compile additional information to help inform my solution and hunt down precedent to compare best practices or new trends.  I tend to jot my understanding of the task into a simple notepad file to help me organize preliminary thoughts and routes to explore. 
<p>
Afterwards, I begin a low-fidelity wireframe to help establish content layout, user flows, and key interactions.  There is some playfulness in this creative process, as I explore some concepts that may lead to dead ends but help refine the end product.  In this case I began by laying out the collection view with its filtering actions, making a prominent ‘Add Agent’ CTA,  and designing a simple small card to organize prominent information.  The filtering choices are based on the Carrier’s profile, so only the available states and policies are selectable.
<p>
From there, I moved on to the detail view of the Agent Card.  Because this screen needed to organize a lot of information, I elected to group the data types into specific sections with a persistent navigation aid along the right-hand side.  The licenses and policy types are organized together by state and are accompanied by links to view PDFs of any submitted licenses.  For agencies, a collection of agent (individuals) cards follow the license section to help organize these associated entries.
<p>
As a task-focused design, editing mode must be entered before making any changes to an agent’s contact entry.  I worked on the New Agent and Edit Agent screens simultaneously because the functionality is so similar (by this approach), and behave as a distinct activity from simply viewing the contact’s information.  My central concept for improving ease of use on the New Agent screen is the elimination of manual entry of license, state, and policy information.  Instead, users upload the license PDF first, and the system reads and fills in any requisite fields, which are then freely editable by the user.  While this change heavily relies on implementation of a new subsystem to parse PDF data, the technique is very common and improves productivity while alleviating what I see as a major pain point in this workflow.  I apologize for the clunky expression of this concept in the mockup, as this particular workflow is more difficult to convey using an app that relies on hotspots to advance slides!
<p>
On that note, I have to specify that I’m not a programmer by trade.  While I have hand-coded HTML/CSS in the past, it was quite a while ago and not in a professional capacity so I wouldn’t count it among my skill set. I am, however, always investigating and learning new UI tools like Figma (used for this project) which creates CSS snippets from the design and Webflow which exports usable code (HTML, CSS, and Javascript) even as I follow my more traditional workflow.
<p>
And with that, a final thanks for reaching out and considering me for a UI/UX design position with BriteCore! If you have any more questions or comments about what I’ve shared here, don’t hesitate to ask, as I’m sure there’s some thoughts I might have left out or forgotten while I was putting this together.
<p>
All the best, </br>
Kevin Brandi
